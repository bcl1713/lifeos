# LifeOS architecture

## Initial deployment boundary

LifeOS is a private application container deployed by Portainer on the existing TrueNAS Docker host. Application source lives in the private `bcl1713/lifeos` repository. The Portainer deployment definition will live in `bcl1713/homelab-stacks` under `stacks/apps/lifeos/`.

## Initial runtime

- FastAPI application
- SQLite with WAL mode for the first persistence implementation
- Persistent application data mounted at `/data`
- Private proxy-network attachment
- Browser sessions and a separate agent credential
- GHCR images published from semantic-version tags

## Source-of-truth boundary

- `/home/brian/wiki`: durable context, PARA notes, source records, and project/Area links
- LifeOS database: active tasks, schedules, recurrence, task relationships, completion history, and audit records
- Google Tasks: migration source until verified cutover, then historical reference only
